This is my site where I do what I want!! Whether that means putting up random info, experimenting with WordPress replacing said wordpress site with Jekyll or testing out some ideas.

I work for [P2PU](https://p2pu.org) where we are working hard to make learning on the internet more awesome than it already is. I'm also interested in the maker movement, photography, the outdoors, learning things and more.

Find me on [twitter](https://twitter.com/riskycud) or if you would like to get into contact with me via email - send a mail to dirkXcXuys@gmail.com, just remove the all the "X"s.
