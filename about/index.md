I believe technology has the potential to change the world for the better.

I want to contribute by thoughtfully applying technology to problems that matter.

I have taken several projects from the conceptual phase to deployment, from gathering requirements to doing sysops.

I relish back-end and conceptual development and enjoy being challenged by problems that requires more than the contentional solution.

I work for [P2PU](https://p2pu.org) where we are working hard to bring learning on the internet to real people in physical places.

I'm also interested in the maker movement, open source, photography, the outdoors, learning things and more.
