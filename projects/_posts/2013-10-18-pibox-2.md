My [Raspberry Pi](http://www.raspberrypi.org/) needed a new home ([the old one](http://thebacklog.net/2012/08/04/pi-in-a-box/)) and I didn&#8217;t feel like killing the planet more. I made a simple case from an old cereal box that doesn&#8217;t require any glue! It is a very simple case and only requires some old cardboard and a carpet knife.

This is the box unfolded:

This is the folded box from the one side:

This is the folded box from the other side:

And here is a printout that you can use to make your very own Pi Box! Click the image to download a printable PDF.
