Grouping learners for a sound engineering course according to music taste. Working with the genial Alex Ruthmann on a course involving Peter Gabriel we decided to group groupies together. I used the k-means algorithm to put learners with similar musical taste as per the EchoNest API together in a group. I never thought I'd use this bit of university knowledge.
