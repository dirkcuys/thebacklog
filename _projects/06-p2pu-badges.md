An open badge issuing platform built to encourage project based learning and peer feedback. None of the gamification hoohaa. I worked with the always insightful Vanessa Gennarelli to build this project from concept to pre-MVP and handed it over to the trustworthy hands of Erika Pogorelc to launch and shephard.
