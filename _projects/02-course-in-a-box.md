A course 'un-platform' where you get the help you need to get started and the freedom to break out of the box when you need to. You own all the pieces and when it breaks, the pieces are still yours. 

[The box](http://howto.p2pu.org), [the source](https://github.com/p2pu/course-in-a-box), [the meta](http://info.p2pu.org/2015/04/27/learning-right-out-of-the-box/).
