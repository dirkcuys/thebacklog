    yes, i know it’s been a while. it will probably be some time longer until i write something on this piece of toilette paper (yes tumblr, i just called you toilet paper), but here goes
  </p>
  
  <p>
    how about an app that tell you how many physical pages you have read on the web? this infinite scroll thing is making it difficult for me to know how much i’ve read.

    this is a little puzzle game where you have to solve two mazes simultaneously. you have two players, each stuck in their own little maze. you control both players at the same time and the challenge is to solve both mazes. to complicate things, there are traps in both mazes that your players must avoid.

    organizing to attend events with friends are more trouble than it should be. there should be an app that allows you to setup a booking for an event.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    you invite your friends and set a deadline by when the booking should be made. everyone is notified and they can confirm and sort out their own payment. when the deadline occurs the booking gets made for everyone that confirmed. simple, easy!

    how about letting out those unused processing power on your mobile. it only happens when your phone is being charged and the screen is locked. preferably only jobs with low bandwith requirements, but jobs requiring more bandwidth may be higher paying. wonder how does all the smartphones in the world compare with an average super computer?

  <p>
    throwing a bottle in the ocean? i think not, that’s called littering! rather use the miab (message in a bottle) app to do that. you write a short message and send it using the miab app.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    there is a 1 in 1000000 chance that your message will be delivered to some random person. the app also randomly delays your message for up to several years.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    maybe it’s reinventing pen pals, or maybe just a slightly better version of bbm <img src="http://thebacklog.net/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" />

  <p>
    making potjiekos is a little different from following a quick recipe. it’s an activity that can take as long as 5 hours. having an app to track previous potjies and assist with new ones would be great. the app should assist by giving you a time line of when to braai the meat, cut the veggies, add the veggies, cook the rice or samp, etc. off course it should also include the ingredients and seasoning

    appidea should help you remember ideas for new apps. whenever you have an idea you can quickly write down a description and select the phone features that will be necessary for the app. you can also share an app idea with a group who can then together evolve the idea.
