Hi, I'm Dirk. This is my website.

I like pushing buttons. Sometimes pushing the right buttons in the right order at the right times can have delightful results. (No, I'm not taking about playing Tekken). Have a look at some [projects]({{site.baseurl}}/projects/) where I pushed mostly the right buttons, eventually.

Other things I do include [reading non-backlighted text]({{site.baseurl}}/bookshelf/), tinkering with something that could potentially have buttons soldered onto it, [walking around for extended periods of time with a heavy bag, dirty clothes and without enough food or wine]({{site.baseurl}}/hiking/) and making timelapses with an old camera.

Find me on [twitter](https://twitter.com/code27_){:rel="me"}, [GitHub](https://github.com/dirkcuys/){:rel="me"} or contact me via email - dirkXcXuys@gmail.com, just remove all the "X"s. If you send me a pull request you'll have my full attention.
