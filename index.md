My name is Dirk and this is my blog, erm website. 

This is what I look like.

<div class="swipe-container">
<div class="profile-photo swipe-left">
<p><img src="{{site.baseurl}}/img/profile.jpg" alt="A photo of me"></p>
</div>

<p>And this is my evil twin with a beard.</p>
<div class="profile-photo swipe-right">
<p><img src="{{site.baseurl}}/img/profile-beard.jpg" alt="A photo of me with a beard"></p>
</div>
</div>

Have a close look, you never know who you might run in to.

Sometimes I take myself seriously, other times I put things like this on the front page of my website.

At heart I'm a technologist and I believe technology has the potential to change the world for the better - if we apply it carefully to the right problems.

If you have one of those right problems and some money, get in touch and I'll be happy to do the applying, take the money and make the world a better place.

I write software for the web using HTLM 5, JavaScript & Python. Have a look at the [projects page]({{site.baseurl}}/projects/) to see some things I've worked on.

I also have a life. I like to [read]({{site.baseurl}}/bookshelf/), [walk around for extended periods of time with a heavy bag, dirty clothes and without enough food or wine]({{site.baseurl}}/hiking/) and make timelapses with an old camera.
