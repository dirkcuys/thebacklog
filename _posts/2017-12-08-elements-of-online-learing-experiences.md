---
Working for P2PU I've spent a lot of time developing, or advising on the creation of online learning experiences. Even though we're (P2PU) focussing on getting people together in real life these days, I felt these notes from 2014 deserve better than rotting in a Google doc. It is a little brain dumpy and dusty, but I left it that way for the aesthetic.
