This weekend I went camping at Cajon del Maipo and took the opportunity to make a timelapse video! Here are the results:

I used a Canon PowerShot A550 loaded with [CHDK][1]. I set the time delay to 10 seconds and left the camera mounted to the steering wheel of a car. Afterwards I used [ImageMagick][2] to scale all the images, and [FFMPEG][3] to put them together as a video.

Lessons learnt:

1.  10 seconds was way to long for the conditions &#8211; clouds are moving too fast and the light differs significantly from one frame to the next.
2.  The steering wheel is not the best place to mount a camera in the car &#8211; can you see the dash reflecting in the windscreen in the video?

Well, until next time!
