Yes, of course I&#8217;m talking about the [raspberry pi](http://www.raspberrypi.org/)! When I received my pi the first thing that I decided to do with it was to put it back in a box. But not its original box, a new and improved box that would allow me to use it!

So I got out a cutting board, a carpet knife and an old cereal box. Here is what happened:

Not yet folded

Folded, closed with some pi inside!
    
I made one mistake in my original box &#8211; I forgot to add a hole for the power adaptor.
    
Although this box works without any glue, it doesn&#8217;t work that well. For my next pibox, I&#8217;m thinking of a way of keeping everything together without any glue! I didn&#8217;t originally plan to go all hippie with the recycled material and the gluelessness, but the idea grew on my as I proceeded!
