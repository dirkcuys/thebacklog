<div dir="ltr" trbidi="on">
  Yes, of course I&#8217;m talking about the <a href="http://www.raspberrypi.org/">raspberry pi</a>! When I received my pi the first thing that I decided to do with it was to put it back in a box. But not its original box, a new and improved box that would allow me to use it!</p> <p>
    So I got out a cutting board, a carpet knife and an old cereal box. Here is what happened:<br /> <table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
      <tr>
        <td>
          <a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-MfPbWS8lSDU/UBy6bD-FaPI/AAAAAAAAALY/CNa6nJdKjVk/s1600/pibox-open.jpg" imageanchor="1"><img border="0" height="240" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-MfPbWS8lSDU/UBy6bD-FaPI/AAAAAAAAALY/CNa6nJdKjVk/s320/pibox-open.jpg" width="320" /></a>
        </td>
      </tr>
      
      <tr>
        <td>
          Not yet folded
        </td>
        
        <td>
        </td>
      </tr>
    </table>
    
    <table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
      <tr>
        <td>
          <a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-LpQHnPX6xAI/UBy6yz8j89I/AAAAAAAAALg/Z9vjDU-Hnn0/s1600/pibox-closed.jpeg" imageanchor="1"><img border="0" height="240" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-LpQHnPX6xAI/UBy6yz8j89I/AAAAAAAAALg/Z9vjDU-Hnn0/s320/pibox-closed.jpeg" width="320" /></a>
        </td>
      </tr>
      
      <tr>
        <td>
          Folded, closed with some pi inside!
        </td>
      </tr>
    </table>
    
    <p>
      I made one mistake in my original box &#8211; I forgot to add a hole for the power adaptor.
    </p>

      Although this box works without any glue, it doesn&#8217;t work that well. For my next pibox, I&#8217;m thinking of a way of keeping everything together without any glue! I didn&#8217;t originally plan to go all hippie with the recycled material and the gluelessness, but the idea grew on my as I proceeded!
