Since it felt like I sent the message below into the void, I figured I might as well post it online.

>   Dear Amazon,
>
>   It's been several years now that I've been locked out of my account. It started when I purchased a Spanish e-book for my wife's birthday while we were traveling in Mexico.
>
>   I didn't buy stuff online that often, so I didn't bother, but one day when I tried to login to my AWS console, it told me my password was incorrect? I tried changing my password, but still got an "incorrect password" message.
>
>   After some digging, it turned out that my account has been flagged for fraudulent activity. Somehow I managed to contact help. I was asked to fax a copy of my credit card statement to a US phone number. Slight problem, I was in central America (did a 2 & half year trip!) at that time.
>
>   Fast-forward a few years, I'm still locked out of my account. When I try to sign in, I'm told my password is wrong, when I reset my password it makes no difference? I can't figure out how to contact help.
>
>   And that brings us here, to me sending this email to a few best-guess email addresses that I'm hoping isn't being piped to /dev/null?
>
>   Please help me restore access to my Amazon account, I want to buy things online, I want to use your EC instances, I want to put my files up on S3 and backup my travel photos to Glacier, I want to give you my money.
