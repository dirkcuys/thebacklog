Most programmers have a stash of old software projects somewhere. I decided to go and dig up those projects I have and commit them on github. They can all be found 

<span>Minesweeper (c++)</span>  
I wrote Minesweeper because of my ego back in 2002. A friend of mine was going on about how difficult it is to implement minesweeper, so I decided to see how difficult it could really be. It can now be found [here][1]. Here is a screenshot of what it looks like:

</div>

<span>Tetris (c++)</span>  
This is another classic. Every aspiring game programmer (overeager teenager) have probably written a clone of Tetris. This was my attempt, it&#8217;s called Blockys Bow, can&#8217;t remember why I called it that? You can find the source [here][2]

<span>Connect More than Three (java)</span>  
I enjoyed playing the plastic version of this game, so I decided that that&#8217;s enough reason to create an intangible one. This was done in Java, some of my first [code][3] therein.

<span>Snake (java)</span>  
Last and probably least as well. At some time in my life I was clearly bored, didn&#8217;t have many friends or more disturbingly found it interesting enough, who knows? Point being, I implemented a snake like game in java. As you can see from the screen shot below, everything didn&#8217;t work like is should. Enjoy the [source][5] if you want.

Well, that&#8217;s all for today. If I receive any motivation (in the form of comments or your projects on github) I&#8217;ll dig up that stash of pascal code thats lying around somewhere.
