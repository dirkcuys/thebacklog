What could creating an online courses be like?

I find this thing for creating an online course, read interesting things, get motivated, click 'create your very own course'. Get redirected to my very own course! 

What? Wait, this is also a course itself. Those thoughtfull people from P2PU figured I probably want more than just an HTML template to get started! Here's content to help me get started and an actual forum with people like me interested in creating courses!! Let me introduce myself

So after introducing myself, let's see what I can do? I can edit the info for my course, give it a title, description, thumbnail, all the usual stuff. They also talk about giving the course an identity - that sounds interesting, I don't want to create a course with an identity crisis!

Next topic. Courses are actually just communities learning togeter? Mmmm, thinking about it, that is true, reading wikipedia on my own is informative, but I won't say it's a course. And communities should have the right tone, attitude, etc. I like this, afterall, I want to create a course for people! One way to host the community is to use the very same type of forum I'm using for this!

After digging into the community linked through on my course I found a few people who would like to work with me!! They also want to teach the world how to *Make extraordinary timelapses using ordinary equiptment* ! We had a hangout and now we are hashing this course out together. I love the way they can do the work on their own courses, show it and how easily we can put it all together again!

This kind of course course that came with this course template hosted a unconference on peer learning and we participated in it! We got lots of good ideas on how to adapt our course so that people can learn better together and from each other. I guess this is how we are also doing this course.

Things are shaping up nicely and we are thinking about spreading the word. Actually, this was prompted by the course course, they had a great part about hooking into existing communities, buildig an audience and facilitating learning communities.

We had this nagging feeling that we won't be able to look at all the projects that people would be doing during the course and that people won't attach value to our opinion on the projects. The course course discussed how to facilitate constructive feedback in a community and how to illustrate expertise by building online profiles in an authorative way!

Getting ready for showtime now! The course course guided us through setting up signup in a way that we don't need to worry if lifehacker features us. They also showed us some other cool stuff that we can do like using this analytics thing from google to keep an eye on whether our course is attracting attention.

Before we go, we're getting some feedback from other people also creating courses and doing this course-course thing. There were several things that need some attention and we'll be working on it a little.

We worked through another round of feedback and also decided to submit our course to the *School of Random Though Experiments*. One of their community members gave the course a once over and we discussed how the course could fit with the other courses they run. We decided that it makes sense to probably make the learning community for our course part of their larger learning community. Our discussion during the course will be hosted in a special section for our course on their forum.

We though we had everything hammered out, but it turned out that once we opened the doors and people arrived that things changed a bit. Luckily we were kind of prepared for this because of the course course from P2PU and instead of seeing everyone losing interest the course and the whole experience became even more interesting. The course is over, but conversation in the forum is still going strong and we are thinking about our next course!
